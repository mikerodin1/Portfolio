      <h2>Hello, this is Michael.</h2>
      <p>I am a Registered Practical Nurse in Canada with a passion for holistic, culturally aware, and compassionate care. Like many nurses, my journey into healthcare was shaped by deeply personal experiences that taught me empathy, resilience, and the value of human connection.</p>
      <p>Before nursing, I built a successful career in another field, but witnessing illness within my own family inspired a profound career shift. Supporting loved ones through recovery taught me that healthcare extends beyond medical treatment—it is emotional, spiritual, and human at its core.</p>
      <p>Today, I am dedicated to advancing my practice through continuous learning, evidence-informed care, and advocacy for equity within healthcare systems.</p>

      <p>My motivation stems from personal experience with illness and recovery. These moments shaped my desire to serve others with empathy and dignity. I have learned that being a nurse means not only healing the body but restoring hope and trust.</p>
