        <strong>Meet Michael Rodin</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
  My name is <strong>Michael Rodin</strong>, a Practical Nursing student and Nursing Extern based in Peterborough, Ontario. 
  Before entering healthcare, I earned a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Trent University</strong>, 
  where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills that continue to inform my nursing practice. 
  My early work focused on helping individuals overcome personal and social challenges—supporting those 
  with <strong>mental health conditions, physical disabilities,</strong> and individuals transitioning back into the community after incarceration. 
  These experiences deepened my appreciation for the connection between <strong>access, dignity, and overall health</strong>, 
  and inspired my commitment to person-centred, equitable care.
</p>

      <p>
        I also come from a background in <strong>business management</strong>, where I founded and operated a custom furniture company. 
        Managing a team taught me discipline, leadership, and communication—skills that now inform my nursing practice. 
        When a loved one required daily care, my perspective shifted. What began as an act of family support 
        evolved into a professional commitment to compassionate, person-centered care.

        <strong>Why I Chose Nursing</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        My motivation to pursue nursing comes from seeing firsthand the power of empathy and the impact of presence. 
        I’ve watched how genuine compassion can calm fear and restore trust during moments of vulnerability. 
        These experiences taught me that healthcare extends beyond treatment—it’s about <strong>connection, respect,</strong> and the human spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nursing challenges me to bring together both intellect and empathy. Each patient interaction is a chance to create safety, 
        ease pain, and promote dignity. For me, nursing is not simply a career—it’s a <strong>meaningful act of service</strong> rooted in purpose and respect.

        <strong>The Nurse I’m Becoming</strong>
      </h2>
     <p>
  I aspire to be a <strong>competent, confident, and compassionate nurse</strong> who promotes fairness and equitable care for all individuals. 
  My goal is to support people facing chronic illness, mental health challenges, or barriers to accessing care. 
  I strive to act as a bridge between patients and healthcare systems, fostering understanding, trust, and collaboration. 
  Whether working in a hospital, community, or leadership setting, I am committed to creating an environment that values 
  <strong>teamwork and empathy.</strong>.

        <strong>My Commitment to Care</strong>
      </h2>
     <p>
  I hold myself to a high standard of professionalism, clinical excellence, and continuous growth. 
  My nursing philosophy is guided by five key values: 
  <strong>listening with intention</strong>, 
  <strong>advocating for every patient</strong>, 
  <strong>collaborating to ensure safety and quality</strong>, 
  <strong>acting with integrity and compassion</strong>, and 
  <strong>committing to lifelong learning</strong>. 
  My goal is not only to treat illness but to help others rebuild resilience, restore confidence, 
  and rediscover hope through person-centered, empathetic care.

        <strong>My Path Forward</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
    My short-term goal focuses on developing greater confidence and efficiency in emergency care 
    through hands-on experience at <strong>Peterborough Regional Health Centre (PRHC)</strong>. 
    By refining my rapid assessment skills and applying evidence-informed decision-making under supervision, 
    I aim to strengthen my clinical judgment and uphold the 
    <strong>CNO’s Professional Standards</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">CNO, 2023</span>) 
    for accountability and continuing competence.
  </p>

  <p>
    My long-term goal centers on advancing my expertise in 
    <strong>mental health and cognitive-behavioural interventions</strong> to enhance therapeutic communication 
    and crisis management. Building on my <strong>CPI certification</strong> and mentorship from mental-health professionals, 
    I plan to complete a <strong>CBT certificate program</strong> and integrate these strategies into nursing practice. 
    This aligns with the <strong>CNO’s Therapeutic Nurse-Client Relationship</strong> 
    (<span style="font-style: italic;">CNO, 2006</span>) and <strong>Ethics</strong> 
    (<span style="font-style: italic;">CNO, 2019</span>) standards, promoting empathy, professionalism, 
    and patient-centered care.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, these goals reflect my ongoing commitment to <strong>continuous learning</strong>, 
    <strong>clinical excellence</strong>, and the delivery of <strong>holistic, compassionate nursing practice</strong>.
