        <strong>Meet Michael Rodin</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Michael Rodin</strong>, a Practical Nursing student and Nursing Extern based in Peterborough, Ontario. 
        Before entering healthcare, my work centered around helping individuals overcome personal and social challengesâ€”supporting those 
        with <strong>mental health conditions, physical disabilities,</strong> and individuals transitioning back into the community after incarceration. 
        These experiences deepened my appreciation for the connection between access, dignity, and overall health.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also come from a background in <strong>business management</strong>, where I founded and operated a custom furniture company. 
        Managing a team taught me discipline, leadership, and communicationâ€”skills that now inform my nursing practice. 
        When a loved one required daily care, my perspective shifted. What began as an act of family support 
        evolved into a professional commitment to compassionate, person-centered care.

        <strong>Why I Chose Nursing</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        My motivation to pursue nursing comes from seeing firsthand the power of empathy and the impact of presence. 
        Iâ€™ve watched how genuine compassion can calm fear and restore trust during moments of vulnerability. 
        These experiences taught me that healthcare extends beyond treatmentâ€”itâ€™s about <strong>connection, respect,</strong> and the human spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nursing challenges me to bring together both intellect and empathy. Each patient interaction is a chance to create safety, 
        ease pain, and promote dignity. For me, nursing is not simply a careerâ€”itâ€™s a <strong>meaningful act of service</strong> rooted in purpose and respect.

        <strong>The Nurse Iâ€™m Becoming</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I strive to become a <strong>competent, confident, and compassionate nurse</strong> who advocates for fairness and equitable care. 
        My focus is on supporting <strong>diverse and vulnerable populations</strong>â€”those facing chronic illness, mental health challenges, 
        or barriers to accessing care.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to serve as a bridge:
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
          <li>â€¢ Between patients and healthcare systems</li>
          <li>â€¢ Between communication and understanding</li>
          <li>â€¢ Between illness and recovery</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether in a hospital, community, or leadership role, my goal is to foster a culture of 
        <strong>trust, teamwork, and holistic healing.</strong>
      </p>

        <strong>My Commitment to Care</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I hold myself to a high standard of professionalism, clinical excellence, and lifelong learning. 
        My nursing philosophy is grounded in five core principles:
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <li><strong>Intentional Listening</strong> â€” hearing stories, not just symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient Advocacy</strong> â€” ensuring every voice is respected and valued.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> â€” fostering teamwork for safer, more effective outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> â€” practicing with empathy, ethics, and accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Growth</strong> â€” reflecting, learning, and improving every day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My mission is to not only treat illness but to help others 
        <strong>rebuild resilience, restore confidence, and rediscover hope.</strong>
      </p>

        <strong>My Path Forward</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        During my current placement at <strong>Peterborough Regional Health Centre (PRHC)</strong>, 
        Iâ€™ve set two clear goals to strengthen my professional practice and clinical judgment:
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <li>
          <strong>âœ¨ Goal 1: Enhance Therapeutic Communication and Confidence</strong><br />
          Engage in meaningful therapeutic interactions each shift to foster trust and support emotional well-being. 
          Reflect weekly on communication strategies to strengthen empathy and professional confidence.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>ðŸ’¡ Goal 2: Develop Clinical Decision-Making and Accountability</strong><br />
          Take an active role in patient care planning and regularly review care plans with my preceptor. 
          These reflections strengthen my ability to prioritize, analyze, and provide safe, evidence-based care.
        </li>
      </ul>
